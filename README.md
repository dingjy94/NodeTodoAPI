# NodeTodoAPI

## Introduction
Course project of [The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2).
A REST APIs server that users can sign up and store and manipulate their own todo events. Build with Express.js and MangoDB. Deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Features
- [x] User Sign up/Log in/Log out/Authentication/
- [x] Todos Create/Update/Get/Delete
- [x] User can only access and manipulate their own Todos 
- [ ] User interface (learning React)

## Instruction
The server is deployed on Heroku, url is https://afternoon-tundra-32854.herokuapp.com. This is REST APIs and I haven't finished the user interface part yet, so I recommend to use tools such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to send request and test the application.
